Logs for incorrect values if :warn, throws if\n                          :error. Defaults to false.\n      :static-fns       - employ static dispatch to specific function arities in\n                          emitted JavaScript, as opposed to making use of the\n                          `call` construct. Defaults to false.\n      :fn-invoke-direct - if `true`, does not generate `.call(null...)` calls for\n                          unknown functions, but instead direct invokes via\n                          `f(a0,a1...)`. Defaults to `false`.\n      :target           - use `:nodejs` if targeting Node.js. Takes no other options\n                          at the moment.\n      :ns               - optional, the namespace in which to evaluate the source.\n      :verbose          - optional, emit details from compiler activity. Defaults to\n                          false.\n      :context          - optional, sets the context for the source. Possible values\n                          are `:expr`, `:statement` and `:return`. Defaults to\n                          `:expr`.\n\n   cb (function)\n     callback, will be invoked with a map. If successful the map will contain\n     a key :value with the compilation result (string). If unsuccessful the map\n     will contain a key :error with an ex-info instance describing the cause\n     of failure.\"\n  ([state source cb]\n   (compile-str state source nil cb))\n  ([state source name cb]\n   (compile-str state source name nil cb))\n  ([state source name opts cb]\n   {:pre [(atom? state) (string? source)\n          (valid-name? name) (valid-opts? opts) (fn? cb)]}\n   (compile-str*\n     {:*compiler*     state\n      :*data-readers* tags/*cljs-data-readers*\n      :*cljs-dep-set* ana/*cljs-dep-set*\n      :*analyze-deps* (:analyze-deps opts true)\n      :*load-macros*  (:load-macros opts true)\n      :*load-fn*      (or (:load opts) *load-fn*)\n      :*eval-fn*      (or (:eval opts) *eval-fn*)\n      :*sm-data*      (when (:source-map opts) (sm-data))}\n     source name opts cb)))\n\n;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n;; Evaluate String\n\n(defn- eval-str* [bound-vars source name opts cb]\n  (let [rdr        (rt/indexing-push-back-reader source 1 name)\n        cb         (trampoline-safe cb)\n        eof        (js-obj)\n        aenv       (ana/empty-env)\n        sb         (StringBuffer.)\n        the-ns     (or (:ns opts) 'cljs.user)\n        bound-vars (cond-> (merge bound-vars {:*cljs-ns* the-ns})\n                     (:source-map opts) (assoc :*sm-data* (sm-data)))\n        aname      (cond-> name (:macros-ns opts) ana/macro-ns-name)]\n    (when (:verbose opts) (debug-prn \"Evaluating\" name))\n    (clear-fns!)\n    (trampoline\n     (fn compile-loop [ns]\n       (binding [env/*compiler*         (:*compiler* bound-vars)\n                 *eval-fn*              (:*eval-fn* bound-vars)\n                 ana/*cljs-ns*          ns\n                 ana/*checked-arrays*   (:checked-arrays opts)\n                 ana/*cljs-static-fns*  (:static-fns opts)\n                 ana/*fn-invoke-direct* (and (:static-fns opts) (:fn-invoke-direct opts))\n                 *ns*                   (create-ns ns)\n                 r/*alias-map*          (alias-map @(:*compiler* bound-vars) ns)\n                 r/*data-readers*       (:*data-readers* bound-vars)\n                 r/resolve-symbol       resolve-symbol\n                 comp/*source-map-data* (:*sm-data* bound-vars)\n                 ana/*cljs-file*        (:cljs-file opts)]\n         (let [res (try\n                     {:value (read eof rdr)}\n                     (catch :default cause\n                       (wrap-error\n                         (ana/error aenv\n                           (str \"Could not eval \" name) cause))))]\n           (if (:error res)\n             (cb res)\n             (let [form (:value res)]\n               (if-not (identical? eof form)\n                 (let [aenv (cond-> (assoc aenv :ns (ana/get-namespace ns))\n                              (:context opts) (assoc :context (:context opts))\n                              (:def-emits-var opts) (assoc :def-emits-var true))\n                       res  (try\n                              {:value (ana/analyze aenv form nil opts)}\n                              (catch :default cause\n                                (wrap-error\n                                  (ana/error aenv\n                                    (str \"Could not eval \" name) cause))))]\n                   (if (:error res)\n                     (cb res)\n                     (let [ast (:value res)\n                           ns' ana/*cljs-ns*\n                           [node-deps ast] (if (keyword-identical?
