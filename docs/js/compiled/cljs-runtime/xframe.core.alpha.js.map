subscription is Adapton thunk node\n  - Subscriptions graph is a graph of Adapton nodes maintained by Adapton itself\n\n  1. When UI is rendered `<sub` calls register listeners on Adapton nodes (subscriptions)\n  2. When app db is updated, xFrame calls all listeners currently registered\n  3. Listeners evaluate Adapton nodes, which triggers evaluation of the graph up to the root node (app db)\n\n  1. Initial Adapton graph + subscriptions in UI\n  db +---> A +---> B +---> [B]\n   +\n   +---> C +---> D\n\n  2. db is updated, calling subscription listener [B]\n  db +====> A +====> B +====> [B]\n   +\n   +---> C +---> D\n  \n  Alternatives:\n  - https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa\"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros [xframe.core.alpha :refer [reg-sub]]))\n  (:require [uix.core.alpha :as uix]\n            [xframe.core.adapton :as adapton]\n            [uix.lib :refer [doseq-loop]]))\n\n(defonce ^:dynamic db (adapton/aref {}))\n\n(defonce ^:private subs-registry (atom {}))\n\n(defn -reg-sub [name f]\n  (swap! subs-registry assoc name f))\n\n#?(:cljs\n   (def ^:private subs-in-order #js []))\n\n(defn notify-listeners!
